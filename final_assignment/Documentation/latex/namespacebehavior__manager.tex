\subsection{Detailed Description}
Here is implemented the state machine that controls the switch between the behaviours of the robot. 

A finite-\/state machine (F\+SM) is a behavior model that consists of a finite number of states. Based on the current state and a given input the machine performs state transitions and produces outputs The state machine is implemented using the smach library It implements four state, Normal, Sleep, Play and Find, and two sub state Normal Track and Find track
